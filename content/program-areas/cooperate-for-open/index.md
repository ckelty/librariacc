We have recently set up a new demonstration workspace where we wish to explore how to leverage our relations with libraries and funders to help small OA operations develop sustainable cooperative long-term publishing strategies.

We are particularly interested in designing experimental cooperative frameworks for existing open access, trans-national STS&nbsp;publications which, for reasons of scale, resources, and the lack of reliable services/partnerships from publishers, find it particularly difficult to get a foothold in our prevalent culture of metrics.

Not infrequently, these publishing venues are the place where the most vibrant, interesting, and creative scholarship is happening&#8211;a scholarship that is also often pushing the boundaries of feminist and oppositional work, and therefore facing kinds of pressure that extend and redefine the limits of openness.

In our _Cooperate for Open_ demonstration workshop we are therefore committed to explore collective solutions to the financial challenges faced by these fragile already open venues.

We first drafted a vision for such a cooperative framework here:
