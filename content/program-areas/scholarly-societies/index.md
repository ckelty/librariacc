Since our foundation Libraria has liaised with, advocated for, as well as designed and developed ad-hoc financial and business models to help flip the journals portfolios of various scholarly societies, including the American Anthropological Association, the European Association of Social Anthropologists, the European Association of Archaeologists and the Society for Social Studies of Science (4S), amongst others.
