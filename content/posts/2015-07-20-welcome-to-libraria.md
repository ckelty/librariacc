LIBRARIA is a collective of anthropology, archaeology and social studies of scienceÂ journals and learned societies that have teamed with the <a href="https://pkp.sfu.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Knowledge Project</a> and the <a href="http://www.sparc.arl.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC)</a>, two of world&#8217;s leading experts in open access scholarly communications, to research cooperative alternatives to the existing ecology of academic publishing.
