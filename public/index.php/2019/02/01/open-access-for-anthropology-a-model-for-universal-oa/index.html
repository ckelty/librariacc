At the workshop we shall present the model of a pilot project we have agreed to develop in partnership with Berghahn journals and select titles from their anthropology portfolio.
The workshop will bring together journal editors, societies, publishers, and funders in the area of anthropology, along with representatives of the research libraries and strategic advisors, to explore the potential of combining two very promising OA approaches.">
