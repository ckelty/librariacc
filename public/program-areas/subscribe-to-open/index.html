Berghahn Books is working with Libraria to move 13 Berghahn anthropology titles to open access for 2020 by providing its subscribing libraries with a subscribe-to-open options with their journal renewal forms during the fall of 2019. Here’s their S2O webpage and FAQ on their approach to the model. Coalition Publi.ca is working with 50 Canadian social science and humanities journals (whose titles we’ll soon list) that are publishing open access with the support of the Canadian Research Knowledge Network representing Canadian research libraries. Brill Publishers has expressed its intent to pilot S2O in 2021 with a small number of their social science titles.  Discussions, led by Jeff Pooley and Dave Park, are also underway with International Communication Association, which publishes its six journals, four with Oxford University Press, as well as the Society for Cinema and Media Studies. Vivian Berghahn is speaking with JSTOR and EBSCO on how this approach to open access can readily work with their content services. Other publishers, both society and commercial have expressed an interest in the way that this move to open access changes so little, making it eminently scalable across disciplines and regions.\nWhile libraries may decline to participate, as happens with normal subscriptions, in this case it would lead to journals no longer being open access as they sought to rebuild their subscription list.

Liibraria’s interest here is in setting out those general principles, so that librarians, publishers, and funding agencies can gain a sense of what subscribe-to-open has to offer, even as publishers will offer their own variants of the model.\n",
