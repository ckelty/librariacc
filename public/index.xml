      <description>Libraria is a collective of researchers based in the social sciences who, drawing on the expertise of librarians, publishers, and other stakeholders, seek to bring about a more open, diverse, community-controlled scholarly communication system.
Established in 2015, Libraria has evolved into a consulting and advocacy network that aims to convene informed conversations and catalyze demonstration projects. Our partnership with the Public Knowledge Project allows us to accept financial support from organizations aligned with our mission and to make targeted investments in the future we hope to help realize.</description>
