      <description>Kirsten Bell is Professor of Social Anthropology in the Department of Life Sciences at the University of Roehampton. She has published widely on the anthropology of public health and her most recent book is Health and Other Unassailable Values: Reconfigurations of Health, Evidence and Ethics (Routledge, 2017). Her five-year editorial stint with a commercially-published academic journal stimulated an interest in open access and led to her decision to complete a Master of Publishing at Simon Fraser University to explore alternative models of scholarly publishing.</description>
